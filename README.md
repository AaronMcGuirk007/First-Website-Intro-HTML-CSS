# Intro to Computers Final Project (v1.0)
By: Aaron McGuirk

> This website was created for a final project for my Intro to Computer Programming class I took in High School where we learned HTML and CSS. I made a goofy non-professional website that was to show all of the different and very basic aspects I learned throughout the course. This is mostly a joke website but is a great opportunity to show the basis of where my programming and coding passion started and grew from. After all they say that if you like what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
